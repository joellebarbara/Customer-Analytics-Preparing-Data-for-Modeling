# PROJECT NAME:
Customer-Analytics-Preparing-Data-for-Modeling
# GOAL:
Apply your knowledge of data types and categorical data to prepare a big dataset for modeling!
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Being able to create predictive models is very cool, but translating fancy models into real business value is a major challenge if the training data isn't stored efficiently.

You've been hired by a major online data science training provider to store their data much more efficiently, so they can create a model that predicts if course enrollees are looking for a job. You'll convert data types, create ordered categories, and filter ordered categorical data so the data is ready for modeling.
